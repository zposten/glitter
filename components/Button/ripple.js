     * The ripple is created when we go from an active state
     * back to a hover state
     *
     * (0) hover -> (1) active -> (2) hover
     *                             ^
     *                    Ripple is created here
     *
     * This happens because on the initial hover we create a
     * really small dot of color, but scale that dot (instantly)
     * to be very large.
     *
     * Then when we get into the active state that dot instantly
     * becomes small again (transition set to 0s).  But once the
     * active state is exited and we go back to hover, the dot
     * is animated from very small to very large, creating the ripple!
